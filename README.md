# Bcl2Analysis.

This repository contains the scripts used to simulate and analyze
two-color-channel confocal images of diffraction-limited spots. It is optimized
for the analysis of Bcl-2 family proteins on a planar supported lipid bilayer. The repository contains two packages:
 - ConfocalSimulation
 - IJPlugins

## Simulation package: ConfocalSimulation

The simulation is written in python.


## Analysis package: IJPlugins

The image analysis is implemented using plugnis for ImageJ, written in Java.
